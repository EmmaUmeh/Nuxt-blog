Blog Development Using Vue.js, Nuxt, and Tailwind CSS
=====================================================

Introduction
------------

This project aims to develop a responsive personal blog leveraging Vue.js, Nuxt, and Tailwind CSS. The objective is to create a user-friendly platform for managing blog posts, including user authentication, post management, and dynamic content loading.

Prerequisites
-------------

*   Node.js (v14.x or higher)
    
*   npm (v6.x or higher)
    
*   A code editor (VS Code recommended)
    

Getting Started
---------------

### Step 1: Initialize a New Nuxt Project

1.  Open your terminal or command prompt.
    
2.  Navigate to the desired directory.
    
3.  Execute the following command to create a new Nuxt application:
    

`   npx create-nuxt-app blog-app   `

1.  During the setup process, select Tailwind CSS as your preferred CSS framework.
    

### Step 2: Install Json-webserver

*   Install globally using **npm install -g json-server**.
    
*   Create a db.json - this is will act as the mock api database for our blog.
    
*   Start the server on your terminal.
    

`   json-server --watch db.json   `

### Step 3: Explore the Project Structure

Upon initialization, your project will have a structured layout conducive to development. Key directories include:

*   pages: Contains application views and routes.
    
*   components: Reusable Vue components.
    
*   store: Vuex store for state management.
    
*   middleware: Handles authentication and other cross-page concerns.
    

### Step 4: Running the Application

To launch the development server and view your application, execute:

`   npm run dev   `

Access your application by navigating to http://localhost:8000 in your browser.

Features
--------

### User Authentication

Implement a straightforward authentication flow using a mock API or Firebase. Features include login, registration, and logout functionalities, secured by Nuxt middleware for protected routes.

### Homepage

Display a paginated list of blog posts, each showing a summary and a 'Read More' button. Incorporate a search feature to filter posts by title or content keywords.

### Blog Post Management

Allow authenticated users to create, edit, and delete posts. Implement CRUD operations using a mock API or Firebase. Utilize Nuxt's dynamic routing for individual post pages.

### Comments Section

Develop a comments section for posting comments on each blog post. Use a mock API or Firebase to store and retrieve comments.

Styling with Tailwind CSS
-------------------------

Use Tailwind CSS for styling, ensuring responsiveness across devices and a clean, modern design.
